# F12023_analysis
This repo contains the python code for my analysis of the 2023 Formula 1 season.
I plan on updating this repo later on with much more detailed information from another dataset. This will allow us to understand driver performance in a better way as points are not the only thing that indicate the trends in a driver's performance throughout the season.
